- make ajax list of members of a group for group invitations

- TODO design issue: figure out how to disallow users from leaving the
			Groupflow Feedback and Groupflow Announcements groups
			(have a special flag for a special group that has specific permissions?)
- TODO problem: when checking that an input parameter is a boolean or array,
			the values should be converted somewhere (because they could be
			strings representing those types, or values of those types)
- TODO problem: check that any function with maxcount/offset returns
			paramErrors BEFORE trying to convert them to numbers (in case they
			were not given as numbers)
- TODO design flaw: if a group invitation is pending, it blocks others from
			sending an invitation. but then if the original is cancelled by the
			sender, the other ones should appear. If an admin cancels and outgoin
			group invitation then it should cancel all of them
- TODO tweak: allow single apostrophes, questions, exclamations, commas, etc. in group names and descriptions
- TODO interface tweak: change group tile to be a link to the group page,
			instead of a small link in the corner
